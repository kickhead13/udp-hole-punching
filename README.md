# UDP Hole Punching

## Short description 
This is a basic implementation of the [UDP Hole Punching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP_hole_punching) [N.A.T. Traversel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal) technique. This implementation is a purely hobbyist implementation for the sake of fun and curiosity and should probably not be used in production.
